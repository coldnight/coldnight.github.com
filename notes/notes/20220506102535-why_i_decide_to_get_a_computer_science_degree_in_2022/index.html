<p>I haven&rsquo;t got a CS degree, it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal when I was yonger, as I was cheap and many employers could affort,
and didn&rsquo;t care too much about it.</p>
<p>But now days, when I&rsquo;m 30+ years old, and not cheap anymore. The employers who can affort me are much less.
And most of them are required a CS degree, so the degree is important to me now.</p>
<p>In China, there are three ways to get a degree after leave school, which are provided by Education Examinations Authority.
As I live in Beijing, it names Beijing Education Examinations Authority(BEEA). The three ways are similar:
All of them have courses to study, and pass the examination to get credit, then get the degree when credit is enough.</p>
<p>But they are diffent in the diffcult level:</p>
<ol>
<li>The easiest is study from network, follow the schedule of university, and go to the proper university to take examinations,
it easy because the teacher will tell you the answer before the examination.
It takes about 4 years, as it like the normal school, but over internet.</li>
<li>The second one is study at school, follow the schedule of university, take examinations.
The difference between above is you need study in the university.</li>
<li>The most hard is study by yourself, and take the proper examinations, pass them, get the credit.
The time flexible, you can make your own schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>I choose the most hard way: self study and take examinations, as I could pass a lot courses without study.</p>
<p>The most hard parts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some political courses which can&rsquo;t avoid in China, it has no logics, must force remember.</li>
<li>Further Mathematics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need a plan and I&rsquo;ll record all the time costs.</p>
